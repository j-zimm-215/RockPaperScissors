This is a classifier I built to look at rock, paper, and scissors hand signs. I used PyTorch to implement a CNN for this classification task. The folder contains the dataset of 2187 photos of people doing rock, paper, and scissors hand signs. The CSV is a helper file to use for classification, where paper is 0, rock is 1, and scissors is 2. The yml is the Conda environment I used. The notebook contains the actual code for building the neural network.
